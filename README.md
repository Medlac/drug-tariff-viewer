THE DRUG TARIFF VIEWER.

This is my first project using next.js and typescript.

As part of my day job as a pharmacist - I am constantly looking at the drug tariff to see what the NHS will reimburse me for each medication I dispense.
The current online tools for viewing the drug tariff are using the NHS BSA's own drug tariff browser or by downloading an Excel file.
Both of these methods are slow and painful to use.

In this project I am aiming to build a streamlined webapp that allows an effortless and painless way to look up the reimbursement price of a drug listed in the drug tariff.
